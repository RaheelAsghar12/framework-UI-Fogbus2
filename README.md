This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,

This project is basically build to provide a easy interface to user so he can 
run create or delete fogbus2 component such as(master, user ,actor and remote logger).
Now it have just made interface (but it is not connected with fogbus2 and docker so we
 can interact with fogbus2 componentÂ directly)
